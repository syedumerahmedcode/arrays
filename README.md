## Introduction

- To be defined.

## When to use arrays

- To be defined.

## Out Of Scope

Since this is an beginner project in which the focus is just to learn some basic usages of an array, testing is out of scope of this project.

## Average Temperature Calculation

We write a Service called _AverageTemperatureService_ which takes number of days and the temperature on that day from the user as input and based on these values not only calculates the average temperature throughout this range but also the number of days on which the temperature recorded is above than the average temperature.

## Find missing number

We write a service called _MissingNumberService_ which takes an integer array containing a number series from _1 till n_ as input and finds out the one missing number in the series. 

It is assumed that the number series is an ascending series which starts from 1 till n but it only skips one number till n. In other words, it does not skip multiple numbers till n.
